#### Currently - Work In Progress
Fictional E-commerce website, made by myself, that has search filtering system, price-range-filter and with multiple add-to-cart functionalities. Used Redux Toolkit with TypeScript for global state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, API with custom useFetch for data fetching, NextJS for dynamic web-routing and Git for version control.

Todos:
Work on the product page which should be a grid (image & description)
Work on the wishlist page that displays favorited items.
Work on the checkout page and maybe integrate Stripe (test) for secure payment processing to enhance UX.

Future Improvements:
Refactoring the code for better performance? and better readability (Make it more components based)
